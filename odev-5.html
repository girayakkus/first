        <h2>Instructions for freezingh</h2>
        <pre>
            Needed equipment:
                 4-quart freezer
                 10lb. Ice
                 3 pints coarse rock salt
        </pre>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Before beginning to pack the freezer, turn the crank to see that all
            the machinery is in working order.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pound the ice in a large bag with a mallet, or use an ordinary ice
            shaver. The finer the ice, the less time it takes to freeze the
            cream.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may pack the freezer with a layer of ice three inches thick,
            then a layer of salt one inch thick, or mix the ice and salt in the
            tub and shovel it around the freezer.
          </li>
          <li>Open the can and turn in the mixture that is to be frozen.</li>
          <li>
            Turn the crank slowly and steadily until the mixture begins to
            freeze, then more rapidly until it is completely frozen.
          </li>
        </ol>
